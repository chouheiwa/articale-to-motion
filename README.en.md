# ArticleToMotion

ArticleToMotion is a macOS and Linux CLI for producing vertical motion-graphics videos.

The canvas is chosen once at `am init` — interactively, or with `--canvas vertical-3x4` / `--canvas vertical-9x16` (1080×1440 and 1080×1920, both 30fps). Non-interactive environments must pass `--canvas` explicitly; there is no silent default. It can split a final SRT into concurrently rendered scenes or drive a complete script, TTS, subtitle, cover, audio, and publishing workflow.

The Go release ships as one `am` binary with embedded project templates. It does not require Python. `am init` installs a pinned official HyperFrames skill release instead of redistributing local skill files.

## Install and initialize

Download the appropriate archive from GitHub Releases, verify it with `checksums.txt`, and place `am` on `PATH`. Requirements:

- macOS or Linux (amd64/arm64)
- Node.js 22+
- Git, FFmpeg, FFprobe
- At least one authenticated CLI: Codex, Claude Code, Qoder, CodeBuddy, or OpenCode

```bash
am init my-video                          # interactive canvas picker
am init my-video --canvas vertical-9x16   # or specify explicitly
cd my-video
```

Canvas is chosen once at init and written to `frame.md`. Built-in presets:

| Preset | Canvas | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `vertical-3x4` | 1080×1440, 30fps | Default, knowledge/tech vertical |
| `vertical-9x16` | 1080×1920, 30fps | Full-screen vertical (TikTok, etc.) |

Non-interactive environments (CI, pipes) must pass `--canvas` explicitly; there is no silent default.

`am init` refuses to overwrite existing files with different content. By default it installs the pinned HyperFrames 0.8.14 skills into the project's `.agents/skills/`, alongside the binary-delivered `text-to-lottie` and `algorithmic-art`; use `--skip-hyperframes` for offline or CI environments.

Skills go into the project rather than `$HOME` because that is the only way projects stop clobbering each other: the upstream installer only honours `homedir`, so a machine has exactly one copy — with two projects pinned to different versions, whichever was initialized last wins. The install never writes to your HOME; the upstream installer runs in a temporary directory outside the project and its output is moved in.

#### Why the skill install bypasses the upstream installer

Upstream `hyperframes skills` shallow-clones the repository's **default branch** and takes the skills from it; it offers no way to name a tag or commit. Installing with `hyperframes@0.8.1` and `hyperframes@0.8.14` on the same machine yields byte-identical trees, both matching whatever `main` held that day — the version string pins the CLI binary, while skill content (which drives the rendered motion) drifts with upstream trunk.

So `am init` does not call it. It shallow-clones the tag `v<version>` itself and takes every directory containing `SKILL.md` from `skills/` and `.agents/skills/`. On the same commit this selection is byte-identical to the upstream installer's output. Three gates keep the result deterministic:

- **Commit check** — tags can be force-moved; if the resolved commit differs from `PinnedSkillsCommit`, the install is refused.
- **Count check** — if upstream relocates a directory, directory-based assembly would silently install a partial set, and a renderer that cannot find a skill does not fail, it invents its own approach. A count other than `PinnedSkillsCount` is refused.
- **Environment isolation** — `GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1` (the repo has LFS media; machines with git-lfs would materialize real files while others keep pointers, so the same commit would yield different trees) and `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL/SYSTEM=/dev/null` (user filters and autocrlf must not affect the checkout).

The result is recorded in `.agents/skills/hyperframes-upstream.json`: version, upstream commit, and a content digest per skill directory. To move the pin, change `PinnedVersion` / `PinnedSkillsCommit` / `PinnedSkillsCount` in `internal/hyperframes`.

Installing skills requires `git` (no longer Node/npx); use `--skip-hyperframes` for offline or CI environments.

Initialization also writes the binary's built-in skill tree to the project's `.agents/skills/`, where the renderer discovers it automatically:

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `text-to-lottie` | Lottie layers inside a scene: logo reveals, icons, loaders, SVG stroke-on, vector effects |
| `algorithmic-art` | Algorithmic and generative visuals |

Both ship inside the binary. They need no network install, and `--skip-hyperframes` does not affect them.

Edit `article-to-motion.conf` to choose the orchestrator and renderer (they may be the same CLI):

```text
ORCHESTRATOR=codex
RENDERER=claude
TTS_PROVIDER=minimax
SCENE_JOBS=3
```

Priority: environment variables > project `.env` > config file > built-in defaults. The project `.env` must not store API Keys, Tokens, Secrets, or Passwords.

Narration mode is the second one-time dimension at init, alongside canvas: `--narration cast` additionally writes `cast.yaml` and an empty `cast/` directory, entering multi-role dialogue mode (see "Multi-role narration" below). Omit it and the project stays in the default single-narrator mode, unchanged from before.

## Run

For an existing final `transcription.srt`:

```bash
am run
```

For complete production from an article or spoken script:

```bash
am run PROMPT-PRODUCTION.md
```

`am run` prepends the directory of the current `am` executable to the orchestrator process's `PATH` and exposes its absolute path as `AM_EXECUTABLE`. Commands such as `am scene ...` in the prompt therefore resolve to the same CLI that started the workflow, without copying the binary into each project.

Scene operations are available directly:

```bash
am scene run scenes/scene-001
am scene run-all scenes/ --jobs 3 --retries 2 --report-json production/run-report.json
```

Existing outputs are skipped; inputs newer than the output mark it as stale — use `--force` to re-render. Interruptions stop new tasks, terminate in-flight process groups, and write a partial report.

AI CLIs run in project-scoped safe mode by default. `am --unsafe run` explicitly restores bypass/auto-approval behavior and should only be used for trusted projects. Extra environment variables in safe mode must be named in `AM_PASSTHROUGH_ENV`.

## Multi-role narration

In a project created with `am init --narration cast`, the presence of `cast.yaml` (the project's roster) and the `cast/` directory is itself the mode switch: an older project without them behaves exactly as before.

A character pack is a directory under `cast/<id>/`: `character.yaml` is the single source of truth (voice, rig joints, poses, optional multi-view/turn paths), paired with one `rig.svg` per view, plus a `dna.md` that documents the character for the orchestrating agent — it is not used at render time.

```bash
am cast new heiwa                        # scaffold a pack and register it in cast.yaml (voiceId left blank)
am cast add ../shared-characters/heiwa   # import an external pack: copy into cast/ and register in cast.yaml
am cast validate                         # validate every pack registered in cast.yaml, regenerate character.json
am cast preview cast/heiwa               # render a contact sheet per named pose for a visual sanity check
```

Editing `character.yaml` by hand does not auto-sync: `character.json` — what the renderer actually reads — is only regenerated when `new`/`add`/`validate` succeeds, so always re-run `am cast validate` after a manual edit. That command also flags a missing voice entry for the current `TTS_PROVIDER` (without affecting the exit code, so it surfaces right after you build the pack); the hard gate before publishing is `am validate cast` (see "Validate, archive, and develop" below).

Per-speaker synthesized audio needs to be rebuilt into one timeline and then sliced into per-scene beats once scenes are cut — both are "silently wrong if miscalculated" arithmetic, so they live in Go rather than in the orchestrating agent:

```bash
am dialogue assemble   # read production/audio/plan.json, produce voice.wav / SRT / dialogue.json
am dialogue beats      # after scenes are cut, recompute each scene.json's cast.beats from dialogue.json
```

The authoring conventions (how to segment dialogue scripts, how to fill a scene's `cast` block) ship with the project as `PROMPT-CAST-ADDENDUM.md`, in effect whenever `cast.yaml` exists.

## Inspect frames and concatenate

A successful render is not a correct picture: text can be unreadable against the artwork, CJK glyphs can silently fall back to boxes, an animation can freeze halfway — all of that still exits 0. Extracting frames and looking at them is the only way to catch it early.

```bash
# Extract frames for visual review; --at takes seconds, percentages, and end
am scene frames scenes/scene-001 --at 0,50%,end
am scene frames scenes/scene-001 --at 0 --check-blank   # a blank cover frame fails

# Concatenate scenes in order into a silent master, stream-copied when specs match
am concat scenes/ --out production/silent-master.mp4 --dry-run
am concat scenes/ --out production/silent-master.mp4
```

`am concat` deliberately offers no retiming. A resolution or frame-rate mismatch fails and asks you to re-render the scene rather than scaling or resampling — the former loses quality, the latter moves the timeline.

## Validate, archive, and develop

```bash
am validate publish publish.md --project-root .
am validate style --project-root .
am validate style --project-root . --regenerate-examples  # requires rsvg-convert and magick

# Multi-role projects: does the roster, the dialogue timeline (dialogue.json), and every
# scene's beats agree? Single-narrator projects (no cast.yaml) are skipped, exit 0
am validate cast --project-root .

# Machine acceptance: canvas, frame rate, codec, pixel format, frame count, audio
# — all checked at once, with every mismatch reported in a single pass
am validate video production/silent-master.mp4 --silent --decode
am validate video final.mp4 --audio --expect-frames 8340 --check-frame-zero \
  --report-json production/final-check.json

am archive --dry-run
am archive
```

`--expect-frames` and `--decode` decode the whole file, so they cost time proportional to its length and are off by default. Read the file written by `--report-json` to decide what happened; do not parse the terminal output.

## Development

```bash
go build ./cmd/am
go test ./...
go test -race ./...
go vet ./...
```

## Optional solo song explainers

Speech remains the default. `am init DIR --canvas vertical-3x4 --delivery song`
creates `song.yaml`; `am song init` adds song assets to an existing project without
overwriting different content. Song + cast and mixed speech/song are not supported.
`am run` selects the song workflow and appends its contract to explicit prompts.

1. Run `am song providers`, choose a platform with `am song configure --provider PLATFORM`,
   set the displayed environment variable locally, edit `lyrics.txt`, then run `am song doctor`.
2. Run `am song generate` (two serial candidates), or
   `am song import song.mp3 --lyrics lyrics.txt`.
3. Stop for the user to listen and run `am song select CANDIDATE`.
4. Run `am song prepare`. Review lyrics, terminology and timing; correct the draft
   if needed, then import with `am song prepare --timeline FILE --reviewed`.
5. Create integer-frame scenes covering the entire audio, then run
   `am song cues scenes/` and `am validate song`.
6. Run `am scene run-all scenes/ --song-timeline production/song/timeline.json`,
   inspect rendered frames, and concatenate the silent master.
7. Run `am song mux production/silent-master.mp4 --out final.mp4`.

For browser-based generation without API credentials, run
`am song configure --provider manual`. The song workflow writes lyrics and style,
then `am song handoff` displays copyable text and records `waiting_for_audio` in
`production/song/web-handoff.json`. Pause for the user to generate/download audio
in their chosen website and provide an attachment or a local file path. Resume in
the same conversation or with another `am run`; no idle process is required.
`am song receive AUDIO` imports with the handed-off lyric snapshot and records the
candidate, without automatically selecting or aligning it. Repeated receipt of the
same file reuses the candidate. Changed lyrics require `handoff --refresh` and a new
website generation; if the website changed the lyrics, explicitly import with
`am song import AUDIO --lyrics FINAL_LYRICS`. Manual `generate` only hands off;
media/Python dependencies are needed later for receiving/alignment.

`am song providers [PLATFORM]` provides signup/key links, access requirements and
redacted credential status without a project or network call. `configure` updates
platform fields while preserving lyrics, style and YAML comments. Supported hosted
providers are `bailian` (`DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`, Beijing workspace via `--workspace`,
Fun-Music invitation, ordinary pay-as-you-go key; currently outside Token Plan),
`elevenlabs` (`ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, paid Music API access), `mureka` (`MUREKA_API_KEY`, pinned `mureka-9.5`, separate API credits),
`lyria` (`GEMINI_API_KEY`, `lyria-3.5`, Gemini API model access/billing),
and `fal` (`FAL_KEY`,
hosted `fal-ai/ace-step`, no deployment). Hosted `doctor` checks only key presence.
Bailian ignores style prompts when lyrics are supplied; duration/BPM controls are
not sent. ElevenLabs uses a fixed-lyrics composition plan. fal uses its own queue
protocol, distinct from native ACE-Step. Keys stay in the process environment;
explicitly append their names to `AM_PASSTHROUGH_ENV` for nested `am run` calls.
No configuration command makes paid requests or stores keys in project files.
Mureka explicitly requests one song per candidate, persists the task ID and resumes
polling without resubmission. Lyrics are limited to 5000 characters and the combined
style/instructions to 1024. Lyria uses synchronous Interactions with `store=false`
and expects one complete inline MP3 track; ambiguous calls are not retried. Duration
and BPM are creative hints. Neither provider overwrites source lyrics or reviewed
timing with model-generated text or timestamps.

MiniMax uses existing `mmx` authentication and defaults to `music-3.0`; some accounts
return HTTP 410 because music access is closed to new users. ACE-Step
uses your remote `endpoint`, defaults to `acestep-v15-turbo`, and reads credentials
only from `ACESTEP_API_KEY`. Nested calls require explicit
`AM_PASSTHROUGH_ENV=ACESTEP_API_KEY`; never put credentials in project files.
Identical requests reuse candidates. Known ACE-Step/fal/Mureka tasks resume polling/download;
ambiguous submissions are not retried. A new `--batch NAME` explicitly creates new
requests. Providers are never changed automatically.

Install Xingyu v0.6.1 (commit `e647b2f3480a9f46a027352713c8e2072d88450d`, alignment
extra) and librosa 0.11.0 in a separate Python 3.11–3.13 environment. Set `python`
in `song.yaml` to its interpreter. Follow Xingyu's model setup instructions;
`am init` does not install Python packages or model weights. Missing beat analysis
falls back to lyric-driven animation. Estimated words are excluded from word timing.
Raw alignment reports and corrections remain under `production/song/alignment/`.
Review actual sung facts and terminology; sample line-onset error target is ≤200 ms.

The complete audio includes intro, interludes and outro. Total frames are rounded
up; only the final fraction of a frame is padded with silence. No audio stretching,
extra BGM or speech ducking is applied. Changed song dependencies reject stale cues;
regenerate cues and explicitly rerender with `--force`. CI uses mock services;
real audio and visual quality require separate acceptance evidence.
